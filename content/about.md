Hello! I'm Tao Lu, an enthusiast of many things. This website is an ongoing hobby of mine that gives me a reason to stay up to date with web technology, given that my [professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tao-lu-94b53b230/) career has been an intentional flight away from JavaScript. I now work in the fun (CSS-free) space of systematically trading global equities[^ht]. This is also just a place to write things without having to go through a social media platform.

## Places where I've established residency
1. 1996 - 1998: Xi'an, Peoples Republic of China (having been born)
2. 1998 - 2014: Toronto, Canada (immigration)
3. 2014 - 2019: Waterloo, Canada (college)
4. 2019 - 2022: New York City (work)
5. 2022 - now: Chicago (in-unit laundry)

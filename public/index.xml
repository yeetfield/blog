      <description>Deleting Spotify Spotify has been effective at being my one-stop shop for music discovery, storage, and listening for about a decade now. While convenient, I&amp;rsquo;ve been convinced that there are several compelling reasons1 to wean myself off it.&#xA;Royalties For starters, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay small artists as much as I&amp;rsquo;d like; I end up buying albums directly anyway, so I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to make use of those purchases rather than just treat these digital album acquisitions as glorified tips.</description>
